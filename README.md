<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

What is PlayTimes? PlayTimes is a plugin that stops mobs(Animals, Monsters, & Entities) from traveling through portals! This could be very helpful for your server in many ways. Especially for stopping dupe glitches!

In PlayTimes you are able to deny all entities or just certain entities from traveling through portals. This could be a useful feature when you have a server that limits the use of certain animals in areas. Most importantly: This plugin will stop portal dupe glitches! There are many glitches with portals and if you have a server that allows players to create their own portal then you are welcoming them in. With the addition of mobs being able to hold chests, dupe glitches can occur. Don't test it, just stop it with this plugin!
